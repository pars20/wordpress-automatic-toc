# MindMade TOC Auto for WordPress

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
Welcome to the official repository for the **MindMade TOC Auto** plugin. This simple but powerful plugin was crafted with care to automatically generate a clean, SEO-friendly Table of Contents for your WordPress posts.

The goal was to create a lightweight, zero-configuration solution that improves user experience and article readability without slowing down your site.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Getting this plugin up and running on your site is super easy.

#### 1. Installation

1.  Download the latest version of the plugin as a `.zip` file from this repository.
2.  In your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.
3.  Click the **Upload Plugin** button at the top of the page.
4.  Choose the downloaded `.zip` file and click **Install Now**.
5.  Once installed, click **Activate Plugin**.

Thatâ€™s it! The plugin is now active.

#### 2. How It Works

The plugin automatically scans the content of your posts. If it finds two or more heading tags (like `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.), it will generate a Table of Contents and place it at the beginning of the post.

The list is nested based on the heading hierarchy (e.g., an `<h3>` will appear under its parent `<h2>`). Users can click the "Table of Contents" title to expand or collapse the list.
