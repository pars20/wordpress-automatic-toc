### Hi there, I'm Jafar! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a deep passion for architecting and building scalable, high-performance web applications from the ground up. With over 14 years in the field, I love diving into complex back-end challenges, optimizing databases until they're blazing fast, and transforming ideas into robust, user-centric software.

My core philosophy is to build systems that last. I focus on writing clean, maintainable PHP code and designing architectures that can grow and evolve. My most significant hands-on experience comes from engineering a social platform from a simple concept to a service supporting over 40,000 users, which taught me firsthand the importance of solid architecture and relentless performance tuning.
